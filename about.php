            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p align="justify"> My name is Rakshith Acharya, and I used to visit a lot of websites and create accounts. 
                But keeping them up was difficult because I couldn't remember the passwords. 
                That's why I decided to build a web application to store all of our passwords. 
                In our system, users can create new passwords, delete existing passwords, or simply view all passwords.</p>
